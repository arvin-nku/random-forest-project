Description: Implements classification and regression using decision trees
    with a greedy CART algorithm. Provides methods for bagging and random forest
    techniques to improve model performance and robustness. Includes functions
    for predicting values based on trained trees and for visualizing individual
    decision trees. Ideal for users seeking to build and evaluate tree-based models
    with advanced ensemble methods.
